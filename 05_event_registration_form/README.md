# 📝 Event Regisration Form

This event registration was form was built to advance my knowledge in HTML forms. It's a simple form that asks the person their personal details, food preferences and information about the event. Once all the details are filled in the user submits the form.

I built this project to learn and apply:

- Advanced form elements (select, option, checkbox, radio buttons)
- Form attributes (required, placeholder, min, max)
- Form validation and input types (email, date, number)
