# 🏢 Company Website

This is a simple company website homepage that demonstrates basic HTML navigation and file structure. The page includes links to multiple sections of the company (About, Events, Careers, and Contact) and displays an image on the homepage.

I built this project to learn and apply:

- Linking multiple pages in HTML
- Basic file structure and organization
- Internal navigation using `<a>` tags
- Adding and displaying images with `img` tag

---

## ✨ Features

- **Navigation menu** with links to company pages:
  - About Us
  - Events
  - Careers
  - Contact
- **Image display** on the homepage (`company.jpg`)
- Organized **file structure** with separate folders for `pages` and `images`

---

## 🚀 How to View

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the following folder structure is present:
   - `index.html`
   - `pages/` folder (contains `about.html`, `events.html`, `careers.html`, `contact.html`)
   - `images/` folder (contains `company.jpg`)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
