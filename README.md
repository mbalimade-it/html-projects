# HTML Projects

I created this repository to learn and showcase projects I completed while learning HTML. The projects progress from basic to intermediate, and eventually to more advanced concepts.

Each project contains:

- A **README** file that explains:

  - What I built & why I built it
  - Features & screenshot of the project

- **Learning material folder** that contains:

  - Learning theory & resoruces
  - Code examples to enforce the theory
