# 📄 Personal Portfolio – Mbali

A simple HTML personal portfolio page introducing myself, my background, and my journey into coding.
I built this project to learn and apply:

- Basic HTML document structure (DOCTYPE, html, head, body)
- The head section elements (title and meta)
- Text formatting elements (strong, em, b, i, u, small)
- Links (a tag, href attricute, internal/external links, anchor links)

---

## 📌 Features

- **Structured HTML5 document** with proper `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration
- **Meta tags** for SEO and responsiveness:

  - UTF-8 character encoding
  - Mobile-friendly viewport settings
  - Description for search engines

- **Navigation menu** - Anchor links used to link to different sections of the page via an ID.
- **Profile image** with descriptive `alt` text and internal style of setting the width.
- **Content sections**:

  - Each have a different text formatting style
  - Each contain an ID to link to the navigation menu
  - The last section used list items. Although this section was not part of this lesson, I couldn't have completed this portfolio page without adding my why
